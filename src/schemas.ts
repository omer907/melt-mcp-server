 * Zod Schema Hydration.

 * Every field carries a `.describe()` modifier. This is not decoration — it is
 * the mechanism by which Claude (or any MCP client) decides which numbers in a
 * user's prompt map to which parameter. A schema with bare types and no
 * descriptions forces the model to guess; a schema with rich descriptions lets
 * it extract correctly on the first call.

// self-healing remediation text these tools are supposed to return (see

// invalid call actually gets Melt's remediation, not a raw Zod error.
